1) Define React in your own words
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UI) using components. 
It helps create fast and interactive web apps.

2) List 3 advantages of React
- Component-based: Reusable UI parts
- Fast rendering using Virtual DOM
- Easy to manage UI with state and props

3) Explain SPA (Single Page Application)
SPA is a web app where the page does not reload fully when you navigate.
Only the needed content updates dynamically.

4) Difference between React and JavaScript
- JavaScript is a programming language.
- React is a library built using JavaScript for creating UI.

5) What is Virtual DOM?
Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
React updates Virtual DOM first, compares changes, then updates only required parts in real DOM.
